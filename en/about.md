Everything started after a master degree in computer science in 2005.

Benjamin held different positions with success: developer, project manager, project leader, product owner, architect, technical leader, devops.

Most enjoyable position was always something where he can develop as he's fond of functional programming.

Curious of everything and ready to relearn from the begining, like with haskell or rust.

In fall 2019, a new story began with the creation of North Dev and a new position of freelance.
